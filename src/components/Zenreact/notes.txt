"npm start"= "starts the react applicationCache";
This is the server that starts the react application that helps us 
to see the  react application on port 3000 with url as localhost: 3000.


// In modren browser ECMA6

Same Origin policy: Means that if your website is loading from zenrays.com 
then you can not male request to load data from other website using javascript.

localHost:3000 can not make request to localHost: 8080,which is live-server port.

Bakcend-Server: We use live-server, we will just save json file there and react 
will request from browser to get the json file, via a url same was as u call a url
to get data.

Proxy:Proxy means requset is sent to localhost:3000, and then directed to backend-server.

NPM Start: "starts the react application, it status local server that only conatins
frondEnd".

What is "Live-server"?
we will mimic/imitate a actual server from where react will get data and show 
it in its componebts.

In react we can also run the code like "open in the browser" by npm run build:
 which will create a build folder in that you will have index.html file to open in 
browser.

ECMA 6: which is modren JavaScript.
Not all the browser can support the modren JAVASCRIPT.
Babel: babel is a Transpiler, Babel, is not a compiler,
 which converts the modern Javascript to the older version of Javascript, where the
modren javascript is not abel to run.To support all the browsers for the same code.

React: React or any  front end libraries will run in the browser, not in the local
server.
In local server the react-code which we have written will run and it will converted
to the browser suppoer code by the Babel.

Single Page Application: You can not load the another url or new url in that page.


From browser you will make the request to the local server and local server will make requset to the 
back-end server.(Proxy)
Request send to the localhost:3000 from the browser, that again request to the backend.
